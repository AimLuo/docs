# Data Access Tools

The philosophy of Mol* data access tools is that they can integrate/take advantage of the existing infrastructure where appropriate (e.g. “use ‘text based’ search to determine which structures to perform structural queries on using the ModelServer”). The response format of choice for the tools is JSON or CIF for smaller payloads and BinaryCIF for larger datasets.
